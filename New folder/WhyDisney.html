	<h1>Why Disney</h1>
<p id="LeftText"> Disney has been a huge part of my life growing up. I starting going in 2001 when I was only 3 years old. Even from such a young age I have been pin trading within the parks. Its a small tradition my parents helped start for my sister and I. Disney is one of those things that just brings joy to my life as well as the lives of many others. I've been very fortunate to have the chance to visit many times over the last 18+ years. From the music, movies, tv shows, theatre, and atmosphere, I can never feel sad when I am doing something that surrounds Disney. The music is a go to for me when I am completing projects for school or drawing art, I always feel the most myself blasting "I just can't wait to be king" at 2am.</p>
