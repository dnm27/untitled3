 <h2>All About What I do</h2>
 <div class="float-left" >
 <p id="LeftText">Hello! My name is Danielle Miccio and I am currently a college student at New Jersey Institute of Technology. I am a Business and information systems major, which is a bit of a jump from pin designer. I have always had a passion for art and design and I wanted to take the leap of faith into my own creativity and turn images in my head into physical items. Somes more about me, I was a competitive gymnast for 17 years, competing in over 25 gyms across New Jersey. I designed this website for a class, as an Information systems major, I used the opportunity given to me to create something useful. I first got into art when i was in 5th grade, I always would go over the top on all the assignments in art class. On top of all the pins I have been designing I have also done many commissions for people in the Disney community. I’m also always drawing, it's rare you won't see me with my Ipad, drawing something new. In the few months that I have started this journey I have made some really amazing online friends as well. Shout out to Malennie who has helped me since the very beginning. </p></div>
